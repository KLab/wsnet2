## Deploy using docker

### You want to start wsnet2-server along with wsnet2-dashboard locally

1. Build `frontend` WEB application:
   ```bash
   cd wsnet2-dashboard
   docker compose run --rm frontbuilder
   ```
2. Start `wsnet2-server` and `wsnet2-dashboard` together:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f compose.yaml -f ../server/compose.yaml up
   ```
3. (Optional)Create a test room:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec game /repo/server/bin/wsnet2-bot --lobby="http://lobby:8080" static 3600
   ```
4. Access `wsnet2-dashboard` through `http://localhost:8081`.

### You already have wsnet2-server running somewhere else

1. Make sure that [wsnet2-server](https://github.jp.klab.com/WSNet/wsnet2/tree/master/server) is running properly.
2. Edit environment variables in `frontend/.env` and `backend/.env` according to your setup.

   - [Environment variables for backend](backend/README.md#%E7%92%B0%E5%A2%83%E5%A4%89%E6%95%B0)
   - [Environment variables for frontend](frontend/README.md#%E7%92%B0%E5%A2%83%E5%A4%89%E6%95%B0)

3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the dashboard.
4. Access `wsnet2-dashboard` through the environment variable value ‚ÄùFRONTEND_ORIGIN‚Äù .

## How to use the dashboard

You need to set the server IP uri before start using the dashboard. You will get a prompt asking you to set the uri if it is not set properly. If you have set the frontend environment variable "VITE_DEFAULT_SERVER_URI", this will be the default server IP uri that the dashboard uses.
